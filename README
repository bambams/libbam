libbam is a software library/framework. It is written C (currently) and
reinvents a lot of wheels. It's probably not going to be overly useful to
anyone else, but if it is then YAY! I'm basically using it as a way to
learn about various structures and algorithms, as well as just library
development in general. The dream is to eventually have a rich library
comparable to what you typically get in modern high level languages. In
particular, enough to do string and container operations from a higher
level than typical C solutions are (C strings are fine, but they do leave
much to be desired).

Currently, the library consists of a semi-functioning singly-linked list
(which may become a double-linked list, but that is yet to be
determined), and a not at all functioning circular buffer. A UTF-8
character and string are in planning, though it'll probably be a very
long time before I figure out how to write them. There are also various
routines and function pointer types that are intended to be the
foundation of the framework. My focus is on safety to make C a little
easier to get "bug-free" (or close to it).

There is obviously a long way to go. ^_^
